# CNN Dog Breed Classifier
A worked example of a convolutional neural network and transfer learning

This project was completed as a part of the Udacity deep learning course

The project primarily uses PyTorch to construct CNNs to classify dog breeds

Transfer learning (Using VGG166 CNN) is also used to create a model that will classify dogs more effectively.
